# Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

This week's challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

### Acceptance Criteria

The app should:

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city, which is added to the search history.
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with the following:

  * The city name
  * The date
  * An icon representation of weather conditions
  * The temperature
  * The humidity
  * The wind speed

* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity

* When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

### Screen just after opening the page, should also show any previous search.
